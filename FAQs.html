        <details>
          <summary>
            <h4>Do you deliver?</h4>
          </summary>
          We do not have a delivery service, but we will assist you in putting
          your tree in or on your car.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><h4>Do you net your trees?</h4></summary>
          Yes, netting is available.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><h4>Can I choose my own tree?</h4></summary>
          Yes, we encourage everyone to walk through our trees and choose the
          tree that will make your Christmas perfect.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            <h4>How often should I water my tree?</h4>
          </summary>
          For the first couple of days after you take your tree home, it will
          drink a few litres of water. Keep a close eye on this. From here, just
          check the water levels 2-3 times per week to ensure your tree has
          enough to drink.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><h4>Do I need to cut down my own tree?</h4></summary>
          No, once you have chosen your tree, we will come and cut it down for
          you and take it to the point of sale for collection.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            <h4>Can I put my tree in direct sunlight?</h4>
          </summary>
          It is recommended that you do not leave your tree in direct sunlight.
          This will cause the tree to go brown sooner.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            <h4>How long will my Christmas tree last?</h4>
          </summary>
          If you keep your tree in fresh water and you ensure you regularly top
          this up, your tree should last for at least 4-6 weeks.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            <h4>Is there anything else to do while at the farm?</h4>

          while you are here.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            <h4>What do I do with my Christmas tree after Christmas</h4>
          </summary>
          A lot of councils, such as Kingston, have a service where you are able
          to leave your tree on your nature strip and book a collection. Please
          contact your local council to see what is on offer.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            <h4>How do I ensure there are no creepy crawlies in my tree?</h4>
          </summary>
          To ensure that no creepy crawlies come inside with you, we recommend
          that when you get home you spray your tree with bug spray and leave it
          for a few hours. All creepy crawlies should fall out and your tree
          will be safe to take inside. We recommend that the tree is kept in
          water during this time.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            <h4>Do I need to recut the base of my tree once I get it home?</h4>
          </summary>
          We advise that you put your tree in water as soon as possible. If this
          is not possible, the base of the tree will seal over. If this happens
          you will need to cut 2-3cm off the base of the trunk before putting in
          water.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            <h4>How do I stand my tree up?</h4>
          </summary>
          The best way to stand up your Christmas tree is with a Christmas tree
          stand. We do sell a selection on site.
